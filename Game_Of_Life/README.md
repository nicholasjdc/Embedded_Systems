Howdy! So, you want to run the Game of Life on an ESP32. Well, you came to the right place! To start, you need to have 1 ESP32 TTGO-T1 with a visual display. You also need a personal computer and a usb-c cable that can connect to both your computer and the ESP32. You will want to install the Arduino IDE, or otherwise use the relavent vscode plugin. You will want to alter the User-Setup-Select.h, comment out the default user setup and uncomment the TTGO display setup. Next, add the relavent board manager URL in the preferences section in the Arduino IDE. 
CODE:
This code simulates Conway's Game of Life on the Arduino. The computational part of the game is found in updateBoard, which relies on stillAlive and stillDead (which in turn rely on surroundingSquaresAlive) to check if a square remains alive/dead after the previous round. If not, their value is correspondingly flipped. InitBoard establishes the initial arrangement of the squares-- I set them to write out the word LIFE, but if you wish to change the initial starting state, just change the code in InitBoard, no other changes to the code is necessary. The visualization of the board is very simple and takes place in drawBoard()--if you wish to change the colors of the squares, just change the color in fillRect() to the color you desire. If you wish to change the color of the background, just change the value of fillScreen() near the top of loop(). Hope you enjoy the Game of Life!
